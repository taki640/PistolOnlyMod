# Pistol Only Mod
A Grand Theft Auto V mod that restricts the player weapon to a pistol.

## Installation
1. Install [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
2. Download .asi file from [Releases](https://github.com/taki640/PistolOnlyMod/releases).
3. Move to the downloaded file to the root directory of GTA V.

## Usage
To disable and enable the mod press F9. When enabled it will remove all weapons except by the pistol, if the game gives any other weapon, it will be replaced by a pistol unless it is impossible to proceed without it.  
*Note: It may cause softlock in certain scenes if pistol has no ammo, I'll work in preventing them as I find them.*
